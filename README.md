This is a modified version of the app posted [here](https://devtalk.blender.org/t/easiest-way-to-build-different-branches-of-blender/20363/15) by thornydre (Lucas BOUTROT). I replaced the .bat file with a similar shell script and refactored parts of the python script accordingly to make the app run on most Linux distros. Follow `INSTALLATION.md` to install PySide6 (QT bindings for python 3) if you don't have it installed. If you already have PySide6, just run `python blender_updater.py` after configuring `blender_updater.conf` with your git project folder and (optionally) a custom relative build directory.

- 09/25/21: Windows and Linux users rejoice! This is now a cross-platform app. It will be maintained over at @thornydre's [official repository](https://github.com/thornydre/blender_updater). This version will be preserved for reference.
